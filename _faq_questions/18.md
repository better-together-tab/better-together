question: What will happen to Tab's deacons?
---
Tab's Deacons are ministry leaders, and it is planned that all of them will stay involved in their area of ministry, should they so choose.  However, Grace Bible Church does not use the term deacon in their ministry model, so they will simply be called ministry leaders.
