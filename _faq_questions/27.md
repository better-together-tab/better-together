The best way to ask your question is submit your question or comment [using this form](/feedback).  We will respond to your question as soon as possible.  

You may also go to any elder.  A listing of each church's elders and their contact information is contained on each church's website, <a href="https://tabchurch.org" target="_blank">www.tabchurch.org</a> and <a href="http://gracebible.church" target="_blank">www.gracebible.church</a>.
