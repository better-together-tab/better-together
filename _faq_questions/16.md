question: What will happen to my membership status?
---
If you are a current member of Grace, your membership status will remain the same.  If you are a member of Tab, you will need to fill out a membership "short-form," and upon the church office receiving your completed form, you will be added to the membership of Grace Bible Church.  There will be no membership classes that you will need to attend.
