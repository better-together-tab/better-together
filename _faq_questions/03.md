question: How did the two churches start talking about a merger?
---
As Grace's elders thought about their options, one of them mentioned Tab Church.  They knew Tab's history and Great-Commission heart and wondered if Tab would want to partner with them in fulfilling the Great Commission in Norfolk.   Grace is well aware and appreciative of the loyal and faithful service of Tab Church members who have sacrificially served the Body of Christ with their spiritual and vocational giftedness for many years.

One of GBC's elders, Jeff Shoaf, who knew Kenny Bryant from their childhood days as schoolmates at Norfolk Christian Schools, called Kenny and asked if Tab would be open to discussing ways of working together.  Kenny responded by saying, "We will consider any option that advances God's mission," and so the conversations began.  Soon both elder boards were talking with one another, praying together, and considering God's best interest.   So, after seeking God's Kingdom first, and then the best interests of each church, both boards came to the conclusion and conviction that the two churches are better together than they are doing separate works in the same city.
