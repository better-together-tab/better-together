question: What are some of the most significant changes Tab will experience?
---
Much of what is already at Tab will remain the same.  They will continue at the same location, with the same friends (plus many more), having the same loving spirit, the same commitment to God's Word, and the same passion for local outreach and global missions.  They will continue to serve in the same ministries and enjoy worshiping in a service style that is very similar. 

However several changes will occur, the two most significant will be in leadership and teaching mode. As already addressed above, the Norfolk Campus Pastor will be Ryan Levis.  Another change will be the sermon presentation.  The leadership feels strongly that the best approach to maintaining unity among all campuses is to ensure that everyone hears the same message.  Moreover, the leadership believes that everyone should be exposed to the highest level of engaging Biblical exposition as is possible.  This means that the campus in Norfolk will use God's gift of modern technology to remotely bring in messages each week, primarily delivered by Eric Sanzone.  The musical worship team and other service elements will remain "live" and on site.
