question: What will happen to Tab's property and assets?
---
On the date of the merger, all Tab property and assets will be transferred to Grace Bible Church.  However, it is understood that many at Tab gave sacrificially to build its main facility and in doing so, they desired that it remain as a structure used to facilitate the glory of God.  Therefore, the Grace elders have pledged not to sell this building so it can remain for its originally intended purpose.
