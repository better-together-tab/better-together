question: What’s been going on at Grace Bible Church? 
---
The Lord has seen fit to grow Grace Bible Church significantly over the last ten years, to over 2000 people attending its six Sunday services in two locations.  Several years ago, Grace's elders followed the Lord's leading to adopt a "multi-site" strategy, essentially one church in many locations.  This has the benefit of effectively bringing the church closer to people throughout Hampton Roads.  Grace already had a large number of attendees living in Norfolk, so this was the logical place to start.  A new campus was launched in Norfolk in the Fall of 2016. 

The growth of the Norfolk Campus has been rapid, almost doubling in less than three years, and especially attracting a large number of younger families.  Grace is at capacity in its existing leased space, and in particular, the children's ministry is bursting at the seams!  As a result, Grace’s leaders began to consider options for a larger facility.
