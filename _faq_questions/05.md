question: What does "merger" mean?
---
The two churches, Grace Bible Church and Tab Church, will become one church, called Grace Bible Church.  Tab will combine with Grace's existing Norfolk campus and meet at Tab's current location.   The ministries of both churches will be merged into one another with people from both Norfolk churches serving in leadership roles.

The newly merged church will operate under the same set of By-laws, Articles of Incorporation, Constitution, and ministry philosophy that governs Grace Bible Church.  The newly merged church will also operate under the same board of elders and staff.
