question: What will happen to the rest of the Tab Staff?
---
Each Tab staff member who is employed on October 7, will be considered for placement on the campus staff team.  The current Tab Elder board sees it as one of their primary responsibilities to make sure that each Tab staff member is treated with respect and financial fairness during this transition.  All staff members at the time of the merger, if approved, are guaranteed their current salary through June 2019.  If they are not able to be transitioned to the new team, they will be given notice by January 1 but still guaranteed their salary until July 1, 2019.
