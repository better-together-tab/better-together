question: Is this "One Church â€“ Multi-Site" a risky approach?  Is it effective?
---
Since the mid-1990's more than 3,000 churches have adopted this concept.  Today, it's hard to think of a large church that does not utilize this strategy.  Studies show that more than 90% of all multisite ventures are successful.  Less than 10% of stand-alone start-ups are.   God is blessing this movement.  Some churches that use this strategy are Shadow Mountain (David Jeremiah), Saddleback (Rick Warren), Willow Creek, First Baptist Norfolk, and Northpoint Community Church (Andy Stanley).
