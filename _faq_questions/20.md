question: Will the church members have any say whether or not the churches merge?
---
Yes.  After both churches have had ample time to pray, have their questions answered, and consider the matter, a vote will be taken by Tab members on October 7.  Grace's elders will decide on behalf of their church after prayerfully considering the members' input.
