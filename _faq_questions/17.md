question: What will happen to each church's ministries?
---
The existing ministry teams in both Norfolk churches will meet to evaluate and consider how they can be merged.  Everyone in both churches who desires to serve as a ministry volunteer will be placed where God's gifting and ability best suits them and the church.  The leadership will work hard to make sure that everyone is in the best possible ministry position.
