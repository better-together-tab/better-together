question: What happens to our Youth Ministry and youth pastor?
---
It will be combined with Graceâ€™s youth ministry.  Our goal is to place all Tab staff members in an open billet somewhere in ministry.  Should that not occur, our elders are committed to making sure our staff is treated with respect and financial fairness.   All staff employed on the date of the merger are guaranteed a salary until June of 2019.  This plan gives us time to do what needs to be done to find the right place.
