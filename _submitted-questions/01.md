question: In light of the fact that if this plan is accepted, Tab Church as it is today will no longer exist.  I would propose that no new members be accepted until this plan has been either accepted or rejected. Otherwise, it would look like an opportunity for voices on either side of this issue are trying to inject improper influence.

We will have a new members class in September, and all those who qualify for membership will be accepted.  We hold these classes every September and January.   One of the qualifications for membership is current involvement in the body-life of the church.  We will not accept people who just walk in through the doors and want to sign up so they can vote on the merger.
