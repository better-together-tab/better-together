question: How much debt does Grace Church have at Norfolk location? And debt overall for all churches thinking about combining assets? 
---
Grace does not have a different set of financial books for each campus. There is one combined set of books. Currently, Grace has about $5 million in debt. This debt was incurred when they built their current Lynnhaven facility about a decade ago. Since then, they have had several capital improvement projects, the latest of which was $4 million.
