question: What is Grace's heart for non-caucasians in the community?  What efforts are planned to make our church truly inviting to diverse people?  To what extent is this topic an area of effort for the church leaders?

One of the reasons Grace is drawn to merge with Tab is because they affirm what you have stated in your email:  That  Tab has a heart and passion for being multi-racial.  

We believe that Grace has this same passion as well.  They host area-wide conferences and seminars on this topic, and our staff has attended several of them.  They have not avoided the hard issues and have regularly addressed racial issues in the pulpit.  

They look forward to having Pastor Ed Haywood serve on their leadership team bringing his competence in this area.  The plan is for Pastor Ed to serve on a “racial reconciliation” team that will be broader than just the Norfolk campus but include the whole church. We feel confident that they are committed to this cause.
