question: Project Renew pledge - Our pledge, like others, is monthly to May 2019.  How will giving for this be done if the merge occurs? If we decide to fulfill pledge early, should we let Tab office staff know?

You can continue to give as you always do.  Just identify the donation as a gift to project reNEW.  If you decide to pay the pledge off early, then yes, attach a note to your contribution or contact the church bookkeeper letting her know that the gift is to fulfill your pledge.
