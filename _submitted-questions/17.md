question: The "merge" with the UCON church has not really worked except for Pastor Ed (Great man of God) and a very few others who still attend TAB. Shouldn't we figure out what and why it didn't work by talking to those who didn't stay? I think TAB need to learn from that less than successful attempt at a merger before attempting it on a much more massive scale. We are not a perfect church, and we need to learn from our "mistakes.‚Äù

The UCCON church had about 15 regular attendees when it decided to merge with Tab and about half remain today. The church had seen quite a lot of attrition, and this was their next step. Most of those who did not stick with Tab were interviewed. The common reason for leaving was that they wanted the primary church outreach ministry to be targeted towards the inner-city and Tab, though wanting to be involved there, did not see that as their primary target.
