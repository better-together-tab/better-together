question: It seems like TAB is losing it identity completely with the proposed merger. Also, Grace's staff looks very "white." What happened to TAB's desire to reflect Norfolk's population?

At the Lynnhaven campus, Grace has about the same percentage of minorities as does Tab. Their Norfolk campus has attracted mostly young adult whites. Merging with Tab is an advantage to them because they will instantly get the diversity that Tab has to offer. 

Grace is committed to cultural diversity. Our staff has attended several of their seminars and workshop on cultural competency, and we have discussed this with them in depth. The Tab leadership believes that they are where we are on the matter. Moreover, they will get Ed Haywood as a senior leader. Ed is a great bonus for them as he will not only be on their staff but also help lead their multi-cultural strategy.
