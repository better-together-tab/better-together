question: We have attended Tab Church for many years but have not transferred our church membership. It was my understanding that only official church members could vote. Is this the case? Thank you.

Our church constitution states that only Tab members can vote.  However, for those who have been attending Tab but have not joined, two membership classes are going to be held on the Sunday mornings of Sept 9 and 16.  Those completing the class will be able to fill out a membership application and if accepted, will be added to our membership roll before the vote.  We will not accept applications from those who have not been attending Tab for the last several months.
