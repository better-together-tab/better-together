question: Attracting new families is only one side of the equation. Have we addressed the exodus of so many families recently who are now attending other churches in this area? Have the elders conducted exit interviews with these families to root out the problems?

Great question. We do not conduct formal exit interviews. We have in the past, but it made people feel uncomfortable and most didn’t even want to meet. However, when people who have been around for a while, especially members, we try and discover the reasons for their departure. For some its the music, for others its the preaching, for some its relocation, for others it a ministry “fit” issue, and still for others, they want something new. We have looked at the issue and found that there is no commonality. People leave for various reasons. 

Our biggest problem is not people leaving, however. All churches face this at different levels. FYI, for the last decade, Tab has lost about 10% of its congregation due to deaths and relocations. The biggest issue we face is that we are not attracting new folks. The many folks who are looking for a church and visit Tab, are not finding our church to be a good fit. Many middle-aged and older do stick. Our last membership class was filled with middle-agers. For the younger generations, however, they are looking for friends, and when they look around at Tab, they do not see many of their peers. The elders have addressed this, and their proposal seeks to remedy this problem.
