question: Will a church merger still include continued ministry with and support for the international student ministry at ODU (activities such as gift bags, Thanksgiving dinner, routinely bring the ministry and staff before the congregation ) and encouraging participation? Can Kurnia and Lian Foe raise financial support like all other missionaries?

Yes.  The dynamic of GFV, when Tab launched it, was that its staff would be paid through the rental income it produced and thus be a self-sustaining ministry.  We did not want to create a ministry that would be in an endless cycle of trying to raise staff support.  As far as we know, this is still the plan.
