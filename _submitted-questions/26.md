question: Is it true that Grace would remove the cross from the top of our building as well as our pews? If so why?

As far as the interior of Tab, there are no specific plans for that either, but the building does need updating so that some things will be changed. We donâ€™t know what yet. But there are no specific plans to remove the cross or pews.
