question: Mission strategies at TAB seem to have changed, and local missions (like UDM and International) and missionaries who are now assigned by their ministries to a stateside job are no longer allowed to raise support (I've heard). Why did that change since TAB was instrumental in starting both ministries?

All Tab missionaries do their own fund-raising which has been the case for decades. The people of Tab are encouraged to financially support missionaries as they deem appropriate. The church office often receives those funds and passes them on the missionary's agency. This has been the Tab model for decades. Nothing has changed in Tabâ€™s way of raising missions support raising.
