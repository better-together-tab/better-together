question: How long before I or others get our answers? How do I know questions/ answers of others?

Many questions are answered in our FAQ booklet, [here on this website](/faqs), and at Wednesday night Town Hall meetings.  Online questions are answered as we receive them, and we will try to respond within a day or so.  However, in the beginning, there is always a plethora of initial questions, and it takes time to respond to each one.  But each one will be answered to as quickly as possible.
