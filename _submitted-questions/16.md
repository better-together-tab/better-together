question: Since Va Beach Community Chapel asked TAB for assistance several years ago when they were struggling with the same issue that we are now struggling with and since Pastor Kenny is wanting gradually proceed to retire in the future; Could the board of elders asked if any of our consortium churches might have a pastor to serve as an interim pastor for TAB?

We are not looking for an interim pastor, and Pastor Kenny is not retiring. He is following the Tab tradition of the passing the baton to the next generation. Whether the merger takes effect or not, it is planned that he will step back to an associate pastor role and someone younger will take the helm as the senior pastor.
