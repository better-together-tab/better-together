question: What happens to the missions duplex on Midfield since we are presently renting it to people who are not missionaries but attend TAB church? Where are missionaries suppose to house themselves when in our area for extended stays to meet with supporters?

Missions has changed in how missionaries spend their time here.  They used to come home for a year at a time, and now itâ€™s only months, sometimes just weeks.  There has become less and less missionary demand on the house.  Even when there were vacancies, missionaries chose other options.  For this reason, how this house is administered is something that needs to be reconsidered.
