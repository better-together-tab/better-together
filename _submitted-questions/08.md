question: What happens to the rental of facilities to Norfolk Christian School? What is the relationship with NCS and TAB? Could a little past history be shared?
---
There is no rental agreement between NCS and Tab.  NCS uses the facilities rent-free.  There is an operational agreement explaining how things will be managed, and this agreement will transfer to Grace.  The relationship between NCS and Tab is pretty good.  In fact, under Dan Tubb’s leadership, it’s better than it’s been in a while.  Grace likes NCS.  Several of NCS’s senior staff attend Grace, and there is a commitment by both entities to enter into a long-term relationship just like the one NCS has currently with Tab.
