question: Before the October vote, Tab is offering only ONE day for the opportunity to become an official "member" to it's faithful, hard-working family members. I propose that Tab in good faith offer membership classes during the Wednesday Townhall Meetings to ensure that voices will be heard from those who have faithfully served. The heart serves more than "Officiality‚Äù!

We normally offer membership classes twice a year (September and January) and encourage all those who would like to become church members to attend. In September, we will be offering membership classes on two Sunday mornings - Sept 9 and 16. However, if there are active participants at Tab who work on Sundays, arrangements could be made to meet with them individually. We have also done this at times knowing that some who want to join the church cannot make it to a particular class. We understand that.
