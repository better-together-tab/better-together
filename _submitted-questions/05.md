question: Does TAB Church have any debt owed to any organization or vendor? It was stated from the pulpit that all bills are paid, but we have budgeting deficit. Please explain and report on any escrowed funds or the past million dollar donation mentioned Wednesday night. Has it all been spent?

We do not have any debt, but we do carry accounts payables.  We have contracts with maintenance companies and the like, so we do owe them money, but only once they render service.  All bills are paid.  

What we have, and what has been reported in our bulletin, is a shortage in giving.  As giving has decreased so has our spending.  Weâ€™ve had to make cuts or borrow from savings, but all bills are paid.  We have many escrowed funds.  We escrow funds for each missionary, a savings account, and a reserve depression fund which covers building and equipment repairs.  The funds can be seen on our balance sheet which can be made available upon request to the church office.  

In regards to the $1,000,000 gift, it was made 15 years ago, and it would be too complicated to do an audit of how that money was spent.  However, about half of those funds were allocated to the Globe House of which $200,000 has been paid.  Much of the other half was invested in property which was liquidated when we did the reNEW project.
