question: How would the merger affect our current Care Groups? Would we be able to stay with our group? It sounds like they change groups every year-would we have to do that?

The merger would not affect our existing groups.  All the current small groups and Bible studies will remain just as they are.  Like us, they do have group sign-ups every year, but people do not have to change groups.  But hopefully, new folks can be added as room is available.
