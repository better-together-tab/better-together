question: Why are we transferring our property? So many people have sacrificed to build this building. I cannot understand the thinking behind this.

When two church’s merge, normally the name of one church is kept, and the name of the other is dropped. For example, when UCCON merged with Tab a few years back, their name was dropped. The people of Tab understood this. 

Now, the Tab leadership has decided that it best to drop the name Tabernacle Church of Norfolk and to go with the name Grace Bible Church. This name change is for several reasons, mostly because the name Tabernacle is confusing to people. Usually Tabernacles are associates with Jewish or Mormon communities. 

But your question is not about the name, but about the property. Since it is proposed that we use the name Grace Bible Church, the deeds will need to reflect that change. The elders believe that merging with Grace best ensures that the building and it’s ministries will continue well into the future. Not merging, carries a lot of risks since the building has become more than the current membership of Tab can manage. Moreover, should the merger happen, the facility will be maximized with more people using it. 

We do not believe God want’s empty seats and we believe that the sacrifices that so many have made in providing this facility needs to be safeguarded and used for God’s glory well into the future.
