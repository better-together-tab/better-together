question: What happens to the ministry to young working parents (80% are unchurched) through the Wee Ones Childcare?
---
Tab and Grace love the WeeOnes ministry but understand that having a daycare/preschool ministry in the same space as a church ministry with hundreds of children is not feasible.   

Both Tab and Grace love the WeeOnes ministry and is committed to transitioning it to a new owner and location.  We desire to move it intact with all children and staff.  Several options are already being considered.
