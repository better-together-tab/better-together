title: About the Merger
---

<p class="message">
  The respective Elder Boards of Grace Bible Church and Tabernacle Church of Norfolk have sensed the Lord's leading to merge in order to achieve greater Kingdom growth in Norfolk and beyond.  
</p>

The churches are doctrinally and philosophically well-aligned and share a common history.  After much discussion and prayer, both elder boards are convinced that these two churches can be more effective together than they could be separately.  

Therefore, the two elder boards are recommending that Tab joins Grace and becomes the Norfolk Campus of Grace Bible Church.  

Each church will have the opportunity to process the potential merger before a final decision is made on October 7.
